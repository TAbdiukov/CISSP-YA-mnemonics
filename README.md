* COPPA - Protects minors 13 or younger. If you are a **pedo**, then you **cop it**
* FERPA - Protects Student data for over 18. Think about Phineas and **FerP**. They have to grow up eventually and go to college. It would be really unfortunate for Phineas and **FerP** fans if **FerP**'s student card is leaked to public!

## Scoping, tailoring and supplementation

* Scoping - removing security controls that don't apply. 
* Tailoring - tweaking little details of applied security controls to better suit your organisation.
* Supplementation - Specify used product names. For example, replace "OS" with "Windows".

There are two mnemonic devices.

### First

Think about a digital telescope pointing at the stars. 

* When you **Scope**, you zoom-in, and you **no longer see stars you are not interested in**
* When you **Tailor**, you **tweak your zoom to see stars clearer**  
* When you **Supplement**, you take a photo of the galaxy, print it out, and then in the photo, **circle and name each star with a pen**.

### Second

* **Scoping** is **Subtracting** (controls)
* **Tailoring** is **Tweaking** (controls)
* **Supplementing** is **Specifying** (names)
