# CISSP-YA-mnemonics

Yet another set of CISSP mnemonics

# Domain 1

## Must-know

ALE = ARO x SLE  
ALE CAUSES AROSLE  

(up my) SLEAV-EF  
SLE = AV x EF  

## Qualitative & quatitative risk analysis

(no memory device here, more of an explanation)

* Qualitative - based on guestimates, inference and basic algoriths e.g. FAIR method (probability / impact) or ALE CAUSES AROSLE

* Quantitative - **better**, based on experience and statistics

* Combination - balanced

## Laws and regulations

* SOX (Sarbanes Oxley, 2002) - [say this in the British accent] ENRON really SOX

* Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) - banks, lenders, insurance. Think about some **fat banker** Gramm (or Graham)
![Banker](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/The_Banker%2C_by_Isidor_Kaufmann.jpg/201px-The_Banker%2C_by_Isidor_Kaufmann.jpg)


* COPPA - Protects minors 13 or younger online. If you are an **online pedo**, then you **cop it**

* FERPA - Protects Student data for over 18. Think about Phineas and **FerP**. They have to grow up eventually and go to college. It would be really unfortunate for Phineas and **FerP** fans if **FerP**'s student card is leaked to public!

* FISMA - **U.S. Government information security** is under **prisma**. 

* PCI DSS - Credit Card Security - Visa, MasterCard and American Express. What else is a card other than a credit card? - Your PCI card.

* Digital Millenium **Copyright** Act (DMCA) - **Copyright**. Who hadn't heard of the DMCA strikes on Youtube? 

### U.S. Privacy

* 4th Amendment in American Constitution grants right to privacy

* Computer Fraud and Abuse Act - CFAA 1986 - **First** major legistlation to fight cybercrime. Think: **CFAA - F for First**.

#### EPCA, CALEA, USA PATRIOT ACT

* Electronic Communications Privacy Act - EPCA 1986 - Makes it illegal to invade electronic privacy of an individual.
* Communication Assurance for Law Enforcement Act - CALEA 1994 - Amends EPCA to make wiretaps possible for law enforcement, regardless of technology used.
* USA PATRIOT ACT of **2001** - Broadened wiretapping authorizations, no thanks to 9/11 in 2001.

Think of EPCA and CALEA - as a seed and a flower. Yes, calea is a plant, but let's make CALEA a CAULIPOWER with sour taste. EPCA grows into CALEA flower. Then terrorists come, and the garden of CALEA has to be destroyed. Like the privacy had to be destroyed.

### U.S. Import and Export

* Export Administration Regulation (EAR) - restricting export of **civilian items that may have military applications**, such as **EARphones**.
* International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) - restricting export of **war items**. Think "**ITAR is war**". Russia has a century-old **pro-war** newsagency of **[ITAR-TASS](https://www.britannica.com/topic/ITAR-TASS)**, and when Russia started its **full-scale war**, U.S. already had Russia added to [ITAR list](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/03/18/2021-05530/international-traffic-in-arms-regulations-addition-of-russia).


## U.S. Healthcare

* P**H**I - Personal **Health** Information

* **H**IPPA - **Health privacy and security** regulations in case you get **HIPPAtitis**
* **HITECH** - **Hospitals security** go hi-tech!

## EU

* GDPR - EU Privacy Laws. No known mnemonic

# Domain 2

## Data roles

* Data **O**wner - (responsible) **O**verall 
* Data **P**rocessor - **P**rocesses **P**assed-on (database)

* Data **C**ustodian - (responsible for) **C**omputer (with database)
* Data **S**teward - (responsible for) **S**yndicate data *everyday* ["Syndicate" as in "Business", so responsible for business data.]

* **A**dministrators - **A**ssign permissions to **A**ccounts

## Scoping, tailoring and supplementation

* Scoping - removing security controls that don't apply. 
* Tailoring - tweaking little details of applied security controls to better suit your organisation.
* Supplementation - Specify used product names. For example, replace "OS" with "Windows".

There are two mnemonic devices.

### First

Think about a digital telescope pointing at the stars. 

* When you **Scope**, you zoom-in, and you **no longer see stars you are not interested in**
* When you **Tailor**, you **tweak your zoom to see stars clearer**  
* When you **Supplement**, you take a photo of the galaxy, print it out, and then in the photo, **circle and name each star with a pen**.

### Second

* **Scoping** is **Subtracting** (controls)
* **Tailoring** is **Tweaking** (controls)
* **Supplementing** is **Specifying** (names)

# Domain 3

## Must-know

Security rings,

(Zero) KODU - Kernal, OS, Drivers, Userspace

## Compliance

* **Ass**urance - **Ass**ert (security)
* **C**ertification - **C**ompliance according to **c**ompliance security officer. Certification yields assurance
* **Acc**reditation - **Ac**e's **C**ompliance (senior manager)

* **Accept**ance - **Accept**
 
## IPSec

So to remember IPSec, one needs to remember the following memory device: "IPSec is 2". What is 2?

* 2 of IPSec: **IP** + **Sec**

* 2 of Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP): **Confidentality** + **Integrity**
* 2 of **Authentication** header (AH): "**Authentication**" + **Integrity**

## System Modes

From least secure to most secure:

Multilevel > Compartmented > System-High > Dedicated  
M > C > S > D 

Make up a story, e.g. "MC gives you a porn SD card."

Progression of requirements for ALL information:

NDA > Clearance > Formal Approval > Need to know

## Access Control Methods

* **D**iscretionary - **D**ata owner **d**irectly **d**iscerns 

* Non-discretionary - everything more streamlined:
	* **M**andatory (MAC) - **M**ilitary, and therefore strict. Clearances, formal approvals and need-to-know apply.

	All other options are easier to remember,
	* Attribute (ABAC) - attribute
	* Role-based (RBAC) - role
	* Rule-based (RuBAC) - rule
	* Risk-based (~~RiBAC~~ RBA) - risk
	
## TSSEC, ITSEC, Common Criteria

### TSSEC
* TSSEC - "Orange book" - U.S. Standard 

![Orange book](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Orange-book-small.PNG/180px-Orange-book-small.PNG)

Recall [Star Spangled Banner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqxJ_iuBPCs),

> O say can you see  
> By the **dawn's early light,**  
> What so proudly we hailed  
> **At the twilights last gleaming?**  

What colour comes to mind?
